        <p>Sushi is a beloved Japanese dish that is eaten all over the world. If 
            you would like to try making this healthy food, you first need to 
            collect the proper ingredients from your nearest grocery store or 
            market. Once you have prepared your sushi rice, set out your bamboo 
            mat beneath a sheet of nori, or seaweed, and arrange your rice and 
            toppings on top. After rolling and slicing your sushi, you will be 
            ready to enjoy your roll!</p>

        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups (400g) of sushi rice</li>
            <li>3 cups (710ml) of cold water</li>
            <li>0.25 cups (59 mL) of rice vinegar</li>
            <li>¼ cup (25 g) of granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp (5.7 g) of salt</li>
            <li>1 pack of unseasoned nori (seaweed sheets)</li>
            <li>Sliced vegetables</li>
            <li>Sliced fish or seafood</li>
            <li>Pickled ginger (optional)</li>
            <li>Wasabi (optional)</li>
        </ul>

                <strong>Strain 2 cups (400 g) of sushi rice under running water.</strong>
                 Take a large amount of rice and place it in a mesh strainer. Hold the dry
                 rice beneath cool running water, rotating the strainer so all of 
                 the rice gets soaked. Keep an eye on the water dripping beneath 
                 the strainer—once the water looks clear and not clouded, you can 
                 turn off the faucet and remove the wet rice from the sink area.
                 <ul>
                     <li>Cleaning your rice is an important process in the sushi-
                         making process, as it helps improve the quality of the rice.</li>
                     <li>It might take a minute or so before the water looks clear, 
                         depending on how much rice you are using.</li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

                <strong>Add water and rice to a saucepan in a 3:2 ratio.</strong>
                 Pour your damp rice into an empty saucepan. Next, dump in about 1.5 cups 
                 (350 mL) of cold water. Make sure that there is more water than rice in the 
                 saucepan, as sushi rice is extremely absorbent.
                 <ul>
                     <li> If you do not add enough water to your rice, it will be 
                         dry instead of fluffy.
                    </li>
                 </ul>
            </li>
            <li>

                <p></p>
                <strong>Cook the rice for 10 minutes after the water boils.</strong> 
                Wait for the water in the pot to reach a boil, then set a timer for 10 minutes 
                so the rice can fully cook. Cover the saucepan with a lid so the rice 
                can absorb as much water as possible. Do not lift the lid and stir the rice, 
                as this can make the grains mushy and congealed.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you added too much water to the rice, it might not be 
                        able to soak up the water.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
